# assignment9_Currencies-
Old assignment for course at uwstout - Web and Internet Programming. I thought it was funny...

	The purpose of my web application is to give the user the ability to look up the information for the five most popular fake currencies I made up.
  Scheckels, the fake currency, each have a detail page. That is linked to the home page. The user can select any amount of the five currencies to make a personalized watchlist of.
  A name can also be provided for userâ€™s watchlist. The created watchlist will then display each of the currencies as well as some update information.
  
The home page includes:
-	A link to each currencies detail page
-	Checkboxes for every currency that will add the currency to the list when checked
-	An input that allows the user to enter a personalized name for the list.
-	A button that creates the list
- A JavaScript Form is included, and a function is activated when the button is clicked. This function makes sure that at least one currency is selected, and a name is inputted


The detail page includes:
-	The image of the currency.
-	The symbol or Ticker
-	Open and close price as well as the daily volume.
-	It also includes ratings from fake analysts. (Buy or Sell)
-	An upgrade or downgrade rating from a fake firm
-	A news section including the news provider and the subtitle of the article
- This page displays all of its information through PHP


The Watchlist page includes:
-	The name of the list that was given by the user.
-	For each currency selected:
- The symbol
- Current price
- A fake graph (ONLY 2 GRAPHS EXSIST BECAUSE THEY ARE ANNOYING TO MAKE)
- Live markup price
